    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      The Joseph Gualandi School for Hearing Impaired was established in the Philippines by the Congregation of Sisters of the Little Mission for the Deaf which was founded by Father Joseph (Giuseppe) Gualandi.

        <p>
          Fr. Gualandi, who later became Monsignor, was born in Bologna, Italy in 1826. As a young priest, a providential circumstance steered him to the world of the deaf: seeing a deaf young lady receive her first Holy Communion. A great apostolic fervor to serve them was born in him which would later determine his whole life's career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together with his brother, Cesare, who also was a priest, they studied the problems connected with the instruction and education of the deaf. He committed all his energies to bring the Gospel of the Kingdom to the deaf, helping them overcome existing communication barriers, encouraging their integration into society and promoting their human and spiritual talents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1872, Monsignor Gualandi founded the Little Mission for the Deaf in Bologna, Italy. It is a religious order of priests, sisters, brothers, deaf sisters, and deaf brothers who work exclusively for the social, educational, and religious welfare of the deaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          The works of Fr. Joseph became well-known and appreciated. When Pope Pius IX visited the deaf, he was moved by the very expressive and eloquent signs of the deaf. In 1904, then Pope Pius X told him: "Monsignor Joseph, who knows how many of these souls (for whom) you must have opened the doors of heaven." On April 24, 2001, then Pope John Paul II proclaimed him "Venerable".

        <h3>Sister Orsola Mezzini</h3>
        <p>
          It was in 1874 when Sister Orsola Mezzini joined Monsignor Gualandi's mission and became its first nun. Born in 1853, 
          she laid the foundation of the female branch that became the Sisters of the Little Mission for the Deaf. She died in 1919, 
          and on December 9, 2013, Pope Francis proclaimed her "Venerable".

        <h3>Las Piñas City</h3>
        <p>
          In 1988, Sr. Clarisinda Cagang was inspired by a vocation talk and reached out to the Gualandi Fathers of Italy. This began the journey that led to the establishment of the congregation in the Philippines, with Sr. Elena Di Serafino and Sr. Antoinnette Tegon as its first missionaries in Las Piñas.
        </p>
        <p>
          They opened a pre-school and audiology clinic, which evolved into the Joseph Gualandi School for Hearing Impaired in Las Piñas City.

        <h3>Naga City (Camarines Sur)</h3>
        <p>
          In 2001, through Archbishop Leonardo Z. Legaspi’s invitation, the sisters expanded their mission to Naga. They started catechism and literacy classes for deaf students in public schools, and later opened a tutorial-formation center on Balatas Road.
        </p>
        <p>
          That center steadily grew and is now known as the Joseph Gualandi School for Hearing Impaired in Naga City.
