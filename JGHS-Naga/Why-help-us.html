        <p class="section-title">What Gualandi brings into the educational world.</p>
        <p class="subsection-title">Some parents of deaf children choose the school because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>It only accepts children with hearing impairment; the teaching methods are focused on the deaf, thus, the children are given direct and sole attention by the mentors;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>immediate proof of the effectiveness and usefulness of the oral method is already evident - depending on the capability of the child and support of the parents, their child can already communicate with them from as early as a few months to as late as a year after the first lessons, uttering basic and short phrases;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the Filipino people being predominantly Catholic, some parents have shown their preference for Gualandi for the premium it puts on teaching Christian values; the school, however, also admits students from different religious be liefs;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gualandi does not turn away an enrollee who cannot commit to pay the tuition nor does it impose requirements throughout the child's stay in school as conditions to its continuing subsidy of the child's tuition other than undertaking, at the start, a validation process on the parents’ declaration about their financial situation.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="section-title">WHY THE DEAF AND THE SCHOOL NEED HELP</p>
        <p class="subsection-title">Why deaf children need education.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>they face greater challenges while growing up and, later as adults, as they go out into the world;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>many suffer from insecurity and lack of self-confidence;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>are exposed to bullying, taunting, violence against them as a person;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>lag behind intellectually compared to hearing persons;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the poor deaf, especially, will find it hard to be self-sufficient when they become adults; without support from the government and private sector, finding a job is much harder.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="subsection-title">Why Gualandi needs your financial support.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>it subsidizes the tuition of a substantial number of its student population. Due to their parents’ economic situation, only about <strong>forty per cent</strong> of the students are able to pay the tuition. Additionally, transportation allowance is given to those who live far from the school.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>it has been, lately, relying mostly on private, individual random donations, and because it has been operating only for a number of years and has a lean student population, it has not yet built an alumni base that could provide financial support.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
